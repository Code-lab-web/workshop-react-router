# React Router Exercise: Rolling Stones' Top 500 Songs

## Overview

You'll be working with a songs.json file, which contains a "songs" key. This key holds an array of the Rolling Stones' 500 best songs. Each song object has details like rank, title, artist, album, and year.

## Requirements

- Fetch and display song titles on the homepage.
- Use the song's title as a key to create dynamic routes. For instance, if a song's title is "Imagine", the route should be /song/imagine.
- When a song title is clicked, it should route to a dynamic page displaying all the song's details.
- When on the song details page, there should be a way to navigate back to homepage

## Rule

Always use the song's title key to generate the dynamic route for each song's detailed view.
